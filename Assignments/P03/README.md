#Program 03
### Robert Hollingsworth
### Description of Program:

The purpose of this program is to create code we can take and put into GraphViz. In using that code we 
should be able to generate a linked list, doubly linked list, and a binary search tree. We do this by 
adding elements to data structures using creative class methods. There is a lot more potential to add
more complex data structures in the future
