#Program 02
### Robert Hollingsworth
### Description of Program:

This program takes an already established vectored link list and uses overrided operators to be able to more easily 
manipulate the data. What this means from a potential user perspective is being able to do basic arithmetic between 
integer data sets of any size. This includes integer data sets that are not the same size. An added functionality is
that the assignment operator and equallity operator are also added so tat vectored linked lists can be compared to each 
other and assigned to each other
