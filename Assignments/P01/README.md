#Program 01
### Robert Hollingsworth
### Description of Program:

This program assignment was to create a linked list based vector class that has a variety of functionality
in terms what can be added, subtracted, searched, and initialized. The point of the program was to show that
we have the knowledge to be able to more in depth use classes as well as show our comfterability with 
manipulating data sets using vector linked lists. Below are the files I used as well as any instructions 
that another programer might need to be aware of when using this program.

|   3   | [test.out](https://github.com/RCHollingsworth/2143-00P-Hollingsworth/blob/main/Assignments/P01/test.out)        | Output file that all of the results print out to        |

### Instructions

-Make sure the libraries <iostream> <fstream> and <vector> are included in your software
-Create an input file called input.dat with random or desired integers 
-Do not worry about the output file as the program will create it for you
