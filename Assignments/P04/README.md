#Program 04
### Robert Hollingsworth
### Description of Program:

The purpose of this program is to create a dice rolling system for our D&D game. This program takes in the format 1d5, ex. 1 five sided dice, and prompts the user on
how many times they wish to roll the dice. It then gives the average of all the roles, the sum, the min value, and the max value.
